# GettingAndCleaningData

This is the repository for the Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course.

In particular, this assignment provides an aggregation and transformation of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set that was created as part of a study run by the University of California at Irvine.  

Additional information on the study and its associated data can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The requied data set can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The data set should be placed into your working directory in order for the associated run_analysis.R file to work correctly.

To perform the data transformation, load the run_analysis file and run getData() or createTidyData() depending on your chosen mode of operation. More information on the resulting data set can be found in the associated codebook.md file included in this repository.
